Here is my python script to print a triangle pattern. For a next step, I could modify this script so that the user could input the size of the pattern and it would be able to figure out how to print it.

Here is the code:
__author__ = 'Eli Sobylak'

# declare step counter as line and initialize at zero
line = 0

# see if it is ready to do the first line of the pattern
if line == 0:
    # we are saying that the image is six 'pixels' across
    for i in range(0,6):
        # if the index in the image pixels is at the beginning or the end
        # print a star
        if i == 0 or i == 5:
            print '*',
        # else, print a dash
        else:
            print '-',
    # increment
    line += 1
    print ' '
# repeat
if line == 1:
    for i in range(0,6):
        if i == 1 or i == 4:
            print '*',
        else:
            print '-',
    line += 1
    print ' '
# repeat
if line == 2:
    for i in range(0,6):
        if i == 2 or i == 3:
            print '*',
        else:
            print '-',
