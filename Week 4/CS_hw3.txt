for the arduino assignment this week where we had to make four legs blink randomly for a random time interval I implemented the following code;


//initialize variable ledPins as an array for easy random access later 
int ledPins[] = {8,9,10,11,12,13};

void setup() {
  //create a variable that will represent the position in the array of leds. 
  int index;
  //use a for loop to iterate over the array
  for(index = 0; index <= 6; index++)
  {
    //and set each led pin [0-5] as output
    pinMode(ledPins[index],OUTPUT);
  }
}

void loop() {
  //calls function randomLED()
  randomLED();

}

void randomLED()
{
//create variable to represent position in led array
int index;
//create variable to represent the delay time for modularity
int delayTime;

//set the value of variable index to a random number between 0 and 6
index = random(7);
//set the delayTime variable to a random number between 100 and 1000 milliseconds 
delayTime = random(100,1000);

//set the ledPin with the set random index to be on
digitalWrite(ledPins[index], HIGH);
//delay appropriate amount 
delay(delayTime);
//then turn off that led
digitalWrite(ledPins[index], LOW);
}
