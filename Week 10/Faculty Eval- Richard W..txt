Faculty Eval- Richard Weiss
CAFA15

Richard is a great asset to the computer science team at Evergreen. This class was obviously an interesting combination for both faculty as this was the first time this class has been offered. From a computer science side, this class was a nice journey down something that is not normally paired with computer science. After spending the previous two quarters of computer science foundations, I was really looking for something where I could use my newly found programming skills but also not be as intensive as the CSF curriculum. This class filled that niche quite nicely. Richard was good at acknowledges my questions regarding programming and the Arduinos we were using. But I did notice that some of the more basic questions that were asked by students who had little to no previous programming experience often were left with slight holes in their explanations. This is totally understandable, since the basic questions of computing can sometimes be the most difficult and time consuming to answer, and such is the nature of computing. So explaining things like an ‘int’ in 5 to 10 minutes can actually be really really difficult. Especially when explaining the concept to someone who may have no fundamentals in CS already. Despite this, Richard was a great help to the class and was really in to supporting the students and their ideas, which is always cool to see. One thing I would keep the same if this class is done again is Richard should keep doing an arduino based project. They are inexpensive and a great pedagogic tool for new programmers to play around with. One thing I would change about this class for next time is the amount of projects due in the given amount of time. For this class, we essentially all had to complete three reasonably large projects, where I feel for a ten weeks program, two or fewer projects will allow for more depth in a specific project.
