Faculty Eval- Gail Tremblay
CAFA15

This was the first program I have taken at Evergreen with Gail and it was a great experience overall. Gail’s teaching style worked well with how I learn, which basically means that she was open to letting us just try things for ourselves, and we quickly learned that if we didn’t know what we were doing we should always ask Gail, because there is a good chance she has experienced the problem herself. Gail’s experience with the field of weaving really shows as she can take someone like myself, who has no previous weaving experience, and by the end of the quarter support them in learning what they came in to learn. The only detraction from the class was no fault of Gail’s at all, and it was that the class was housed in a very cramped space which was not meant to hold forty weavers and the fact that for a little while, we did not have enough looms to get everyone started on our weaving samplers. Next time this class is done, I’d think that things like supplies and resources must be sorted out before the class starts. In addition, I feel as though we could have done shorter amounts of each weave pattern on the sampler and gotten the same concepts from it. Things I would keep the same is using AVL Weavepoint to help students design and comprehend weave structures on a simpler level. Another quick thing would be, if possible a contract with a student/TA that was focusing on weaving instead of felting as I feel that was were most students needed assistance. Gail’s knowledge of drafting weaves was extremely helpful while we were designing our checker-board pattern for our group project. This was a really interesting and fun class that Gail and her co-faculty Richard taught quite well.
