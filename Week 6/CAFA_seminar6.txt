I. What are the differences between the 18th and 19th century views of what it means to be human and what the ambiguities were?
	a. Throughout the book, and throughout time we have seen the countless examples of how the human experience has driven us to look for human qualities in objects around us. Some would argue that itâ€™s the need to feel connected that drives this. But there may very well be multiple causes. For example, in the book, Wood brings up an explanation Freud offers which is the idea that children really want their dolls to come to life, as opposed to being fearful of it (pg. 215). Similarly, she talks about this idea back in an earlier chapter and the idea of pygmalionism, or the love of statues. Something that goes back all the way to the times of the Romans. So we can see that this theme is strong throughout time, and people are really really into anthropomorphizing objects around them. We do this all the time.
