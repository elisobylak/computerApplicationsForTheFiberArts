What is the relationship between: 

I. Magic and automata?
	a. Woods talks about the French philosopher Etienne-Jules Marey and describes them as believing that the human body was in fact some sort of organic and living machine. HIs line of thinking seemed to be a bridge between philosophers, scientists, magicians of that time and mechanistic thinkers(pg. 173).

II. Magic and movies/cinema?
	a. The relationship of magic and movies/cinema is very closely related as most of the first movies ever made understandably were considered magic. Woods spends a lot of time talking about Georges Méliés and how his work in film was a true act of magic during that time because he would edit the film strips in such a way that what happened in the film would otherwise be impossible in real life (pg. 191).

III. Magic and science?
	a. On page 200, Woods talks about some of the first uses of electricity to ‘re-animate’ dead tissue on people. Much like Frankenstein people where getting a mix of science and magic here.

IV. Magic and virtual reality/ reality?
	a. The whole talk about movies in this chapter really is a form of virtual reality. For the people of the time, what was happening in the movies that where coming out was a sort of virtual reality. And that’s why today, if you want to get the most immersive movie experience you go to imax movies where the screen is 90 feet tall and the sound is incredible. Totally a different experience.
