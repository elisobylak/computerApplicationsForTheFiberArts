I. What was the deal with all the women automatons?
	a. The first thing i noticed is the cover of the book. Featuring a schematic for an automaton designed to look like a woman. Also I thought about how statues like the greek and romans made very intricate and realistic marble statues of women that we still have in our museums to this today. I think that the reason they had a lot of female automatons was because people have always been making sculptures of perfect women(pg. 132). And Wood also talks about how people would experience pygmalionism which is the love of statues(pg. 138).

II. What are some of the connections in the movie Metropolis and that Charlie Chaplin movie?
	a. It would seems that the relevant connections here is that both of these movies where examples of interpretations of the industrial revolution and the sort of day to day experience people had during those times. Wood talks about this for one sentence on page 118.
