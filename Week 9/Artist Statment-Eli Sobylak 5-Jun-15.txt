Artist Statement:

During walks on clear nights, I often find myself gazing up at the stars. Catching myself in states of amazement and true wonder as to how it all works. How does the Solar System, our home, interact with me, and how do I interact with it? Questions like these flow through my head as I look upon the innumerable amount of stars twinkling, and gave me the inspiration to try and create a mobile of the Solar System in my own mind’s eye. 

During the first weeks of the quarter, I knew I wanted to make some sort of felted planets since felt is such a great medium to work with. It took a little thinking, but I eventually came up with the idea to just do a simple planetary mobile. Which planets should I do? I thought to myself. I’ll do the Solar System.

My design for each planet was inspired by actual satellite images of the planets mixed in with some artistic liberties that I used to make the planets a little more personal to me. The mobile’s design came after creating all the individual planets, which made putting the piece together a little complicated. Although in the end it did turn out just as I had wanted it, and I even was able to motorize it and have it spin during the showing.
